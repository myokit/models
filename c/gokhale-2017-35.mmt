    The 2017 model of the ex293 AP by Gokhale et al. [1], 35 degrees C version.

    The Nav1.5 and Kir2.1 currents in the 23C model are based on the data from
    [2], while endogeneous INa and IK were fit to [3] and [4] respectively.
    All currents in the 35 degrees model were temperature-shifted, sometimes
    using literature data on temperature effects, sometimes by fitting to
    tissue data (including conduction velocity).

    The formulation of the Nav1.5 current is based on the model by Lindblad et
    al. [5], the endogenous INa is a class Hodgkin-Huxley m^3*h form, and the
    endogenous IK current formulation is based on the IKs equations in [6].

    This implementation is based on the equations given in the paper and
    supplement [1]. To avoid overshadowing the sodium current, the stimulus
    current was set to be short and large. Unfortunately, the choice of
    stimulus current has quite a large effect in this model.

    The units of currents were taken to be [A/F] (as used in the figures) and
    units for conductances were changed from [mS/cm^2] to [nS/pF] (thereby
    removing the assumption that the specific membrane capacity is exactly
    1 uF/cm^2).

    The implementation was verified by recreating parts of figures 1 and 2,
    which could partly be achieved (some information on monodomain parameters
    and the exact stimulus and voltage-clamp protocols is missing). In
    addition, the 35C model was compared to an independent reimplementation by
    Ross Johnstone.
